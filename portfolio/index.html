                            </ul>
                            <h3>summary</h3>
                            <p>One of our most popular products is a four-year old online course in mindfulness. The course’s marketing materials (email, social, affiliate) and long-form sales page have never been updated. Sales had plateaued.</p>
                            <p>My task was to review the marketing materials and sales page and make suggestions for improvement with the goal of increasing sales.  </p>
                            <p>We use long-form sales pages, in the marketing style of DigitalMarketer. The sales page includes an immense amount of information about the product including: product description, online course schedule and curriculum, teacher biographies, benefits of taking the course, description of bonus products, endorsements of the teachers by leading experts in the field, and payment options. This is a lot of information for the customer to take in and process in order to make a purchasing decision.</p>
                            <p>In addition to the lengthy sales page, we use dozens of emails, social media advertisements, and affiliates to market our product. This is an immense amount of visual assets. In addition to this, once the customer purchases the product, there is the online course itself.  The eight-week online course contains copy, audio and video files. None of this has been updated in four years.
                            </p>
                            <h3>research</h3>
                            <p>I led a workshop with the Project Manager, Design Manager and Copywriter, with the goal of creating a Journey Asset Map of the marketing assets for the mindfulness online course. We printed out all visual assets for the product, taped them to a large wall, and mapped out the multiple customer journeys. The visual assets included: marketing emails, social assets, affiliate assets, the sales page, and the online course itself.  
                            </p>
                            <img src="../img/asset-map.png" alt="journey asset map">
                            <p>We then annotated the map with data regarding each asset and journey segment. Examples were heatmap and click map data from the sales page and online course, clicks and resulting sales revenue from each email. We also focused on the branding, specific copy and imagery of the assets. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I also completed a heuristic evaluation of the sales page. I used the Nielsen Norman Group’s 10 general principles for interaction design, and their UX best-practices in terms of design and layout in my review of the page.</p>
                            
                            <h3>recommendations</h3>
                            <p>After evaluating all this data, we proposed these changes to the marketing assets:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Making each email look unique while maintaining the product’s branding</li>
                                <li>Explicitly stating how the product will solve the customers’ problems</li>
                                <li>Tightening up and front-loading copy</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These were my proposed changes to the sales page:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>adding customer reviews and social proof</li>
                                <li>shortening the overall length of the page</li>
                                <li>including language that explains how the product will solve customers' problems above the fold</li>
                                <li>reducing the number of items in the main navigation</li>
                                <li>adding 2 CTA’s above the fold (originally there were none)</li>
                                <li>using a persistent navigation that is always visible</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>results</h3>
                            <p>The marketing materials and <a href="https://product.soundstrue.com/power-of-awareness/?sq=1" target="_blank">sales page</a> were redesigned and marketed. The first launch resulted in an increase of 256% in unique product purchases from the last launch of the old design. The second launch resulted in an increase of 370% in unique product purchases from the last launch of the old design. </p>

                            <h3>summary</h3>
                            <p>I analyze our customers' use of the navigation on our e-commerce site and helped create a more useful and usable replacement.
                            </p>
                            <p>We moved our ecommerce site from Magento 1 to Shopify at the end of April 2020. Since the website would be created anew, we decided it would be a good time to make some much needed improvements to the main navigation.</p>
                            <h3>problem</h3>
                            <img src="../img/homepage-nav-desktop.png" alt="heatmap of the main navigation showing zero clicks on desktop">
                            <p>None of our customers were using the main navigation on our website. A recent click map of the homepage showed that out of 10,000 users, the navigation received 0% of clicks. As a result, our users were using search as their primary means of locating products and information. 
                            </p>
                            <p>A navigation should help users quickly find the product they are looking for by immediately narrowing our catalog. By defaulting to search, users were presented with a large search result list that they then had to filter themselves.</p>
                            <h3>hypothesis</h3>
                            <p>I hypothesized there were several reasons why our users were not using the main navigation: the link text was too specific, confusing, and there were too many items (11 links). A common complaint from our customers, that we receive from customer service is, “you have so many products, I don’t know where to begin.” 
                            </p>
                            <p>We decided we would design a new navigation that would help users quickly find what they were looking for.</p>
                            <h3>research</h3>
                            <p>I analyzed our customers’ search terms from Q1 2019. The data showed that the majority (44.8%) of searches are for a specific author name, followed by topic (32.7%), and then by product title (13.1%). The navigation did not highlight these popular search areas.
                            </p>
                            <h3>solution</h3>
                            <p>Working with the Digital Design and Product Manager, I used this data to design a new navigation that focused on the search terms our customers used. 
                            </p>
                            <p>After two sets of in-person paper prototype tests, discussions with internal product teams, and several rounds of revisions, the Design and Product Manager and I finalized the wireframes and functionality for the new navigation.
                            </p>
                            <p>Here is the wireframe for the main navigation and two of the drop-downs. The drop-downs activate on hover (on desktop) using an intelligent delay functionality. I based this decision on research from the Baymard Institute regarding intelligent hover systems.</p>
                            <img src="../img/new-navigation-w-notes.png" alt="navigation wireframes">
                            <h3>current status</h3>
                            <p>The <a href="https://www.soundstrue.com/" target="_blank">new Shopify site</a> went live at the end of April 2020. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I ran remote user tests on the site, asking users to complete several tasks including: finding and purchasing a specific product, a product by a specific author, and a product about a specific topic. Unfortunately, very few of the users used the new navigation to complete their tasks. They mostly defaulted to using search. However, our heat & click map data shows that about 11.72% of clicks on the homepage were for content in the drop-downs. This is a great increase over 0% of clicks from the previous navigation.</p>
                            <p>There are two other improvements that resulted from the new navigation. First, revenue was increased by the product placement in the menu drop-downs. One specific book that was featured increased 250% in monthly sales. Second, our overall user experience scores for the e-commerce site increased. Our site usability score increased from an average of 3.05 (on a Likert 5-point scale) in January of 2020 to 3.97 in July 2020, and our repurchase score increased from an average of 3.5 in Jan 2020 to 4.35 in July 2020. I realize that the improvement in scores may not be the sole result of the new navigation; however, there were only two structural changes made during the site transition (the new navigation and a stepped checkout), so I believe the new navigation was at least partially responsible for the improvement in scores.</p>
                            <h3>next steps</h3>
                            <p>Unfortunately, there is a bug with the hover activation of the navigation. For users using a touch laptop or touch monitor, the drop-downs do not close when the cursor is moved out of the drop-down. The user has to move their cursor out of the drop-down and then click on the page. This bug was revealed during remote user testing soon after the new site went live. There is a ticket to fix this issue in the backlog.</p>

                            <p>The current product categories on our site are oddly specific, confusing, and are not industry-standard for our niche. My task was to work with the E-commerce Product Owner to determine new categories for all 8.5k products on our site.
                            </p>
                            <h3>research</h3>
                            <p>There were several sets of data that I used to compile a list of possible categories. First, I used the search term data from our website. The second highest (32.7%) type of search term used by our customers (Q1 2019) was topic, such as: mindfulness, meditation, yoga, etc. I ranked the topic search terms our customers were using. This clearly showed what topics our customers are most interested in. </p>
                            <img src="../img/topics.png" alt="the most searched for topics">
                            <p>The second set of data I considered was the categories used by our direct competitors: Amazon, Hay House, Llewellyn, Inner Traditions, and Shift Networks. The third set of data I considered was the number of products we have in the initial list of categories. There needed to be a sufficient amount of products in each category.
                            </p>
                            <p>After considering these three sets of data, I compiled a list of possible categories. The e-commerce Product Owner and I worked to whittle down the list to 14 parent categories and 20 child categories. Several different teams then went through our entire catalog of 8.5k products and recategorized them.</p>
                            <h3>current status</h3>
                            <p>The <a href="https://www.soundstrue.com/" target="_blank">new Shopify site</a> went live at the end of April 2020. The new categories are featured in the main navigation drop-downs and in the filters on search result and product category pages. I am still collecting data on the usefulness of these links and filters.
                            </p>
                            <p>One unplanned outcome is the sales metrics we can now gather from the new categories. Spirituality is by far the highest grossing category with revenue in the high 6-figures for Q2 2020. This information will help inform our future product acquisitions.

                            <h3>summary</h3>
                            <p>The Digital Library is what our customers use to watch/listen/read the media they purchase from us. For example, someone purchases "Guided Mindfulness Meditation" audio download. In their Digital Library, they can listen to the product and download all of its files. We replaced our native iOS and Android apps and the desktop application with a PWA (progressive web app).  My task was to design the content, layout and user interactions for PWA to create a usable, useful, and profitable product. 
                            </p>
                            <h3>research</h3>
                            <p>Fortunately, we have several hundred app reviews for both our iOS and Android apps. I read through these qualitative customer reviews and converted them to quantitative data. I recorded each complaint and suggestion for improvement and then tallied each one.
                            </p>
                            <p>Overall, customers were initially happy when the apps first came out. However, due to the lack of regular updates and enhancements, they became disappointed in the apps' lack of features that are commonly found in similar applications, such as iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Audible, etc.</p>
                            <h3>proposed solution</h3>
                            <p>Unfortunately, the need to ship a MVP quickly restricted the inclusion of most customer requests. The MVP is a parity of the current experience, with a few of the top customer requests included. For example, customers will now be able to read an ebook, watch a video, and listen to an audio file directly within the PWA. There are also personalized product recommendations based on products customers have already purchased. Here are my initial wireframes and notes for the product page for the MVP:

                            <p>User flow for the Digital Library PWA:</p>

                            <h3>research</h3>
                            <p>I designed and ran one round of in-person paper prototype user tests using my initial low-fidelity wireframes. These tests resulted in several minor changes to the designs, for example changing a heading on one of the pages.
                            </p>
                            <p>I then collaborated with our Digital Designer on the high-fidelity mock-ups. Using the mock-ups, I ran a round of remote interactive prototype tests. The <a href="https://soundstrue.invisionapp.com/share/XHTL6D17VAY" target="_blank">prototype</a> was built in InVision using exports of the Sketch designs. These user tests produced positive results: no major usability issues were found.</p>
                            <p>Once the developers completed building the new PWA, I ran a beta test with my fellow co-workers (100+). The test consisted of users completing multiple end-to-end tasks: completing a purchase on our e-commerce site and then consuming the product on the PWA. One glaring issue emerged that was not expected: one of the main pages of the PWA, a product-marketing page, was so similar to our e-commerce website homepage that users thought they were on our e-commerce site. Since the functionality of the two sites are completely different, users were confused when they were unsuccessful completing e-commerce tasks on the PWA.</p>
                            <p>I recommended that we remove the marketing page. There was an initial push-back against removing the revenue-generating page. We compromised by removing the page and replacing it with a ‘Shop’ link to our e-commerce site. I ran another beta test with a select group of co-workers, and this time there wasn’t any confusion between two sites.
                            </p>
                            <p>The PWA launched at the end of April 2020. There were some unavoidable issues, such as users having trouble resetting their password (a requirement for switching platforms), but overall it was a success. For the three months that it’s been up, it has held a steady 4.36% conversion rate. </p>
                            <h3>future development</h3>
                            <p>The next release of the PWA will be wrapping it to turn it into native iOS and Android apps. This will allow our users to download and play their content without needing a wifi connection - one of the top most-requested features.
                            </p>
                            <p>In future releases, we will be including new features that customers have requested: bookmarking within a media file, creating custom playlists, ten-second rewind and fast-forward buttons, closed captions, transcripts, keyword search, and more personalized product recommendations based on past purchases.
