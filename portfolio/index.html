                <div class="right">
                    <h3>summary</h3>
                    <p>Create Journey Asset Map of the marketing assets for a mindfulness online course. Analyze the results and make recommendations for improvement.</p>
                    <h3>problem</h3>
                    <p>We actively market this product several times a year, and have done so for the past four years. Sales had platued. The sell page included an immense amount of information and as a result was extremely long and unfocused.
                    </p>
                    <h3>data to the rescue</h3>
                    <p>I worked with the Project Manager, Design Manager and Copywriter to create a Journey Asset Map of the product. We printed out all visual assets for the product, tapped them to a large wall, and mapped out the multiple customer journeys. We then annotated the map with analytics regarding each asset and journey segment. I also completed a heuristic evaluation of the sell page using Nielsen Norman Group’s 10 general principles for interaction design
                    </p>
                    <img src="../img/asset-map.png" alt="journey asset map">
                    <h3>proposed solution</h3>
                    <p>After evaluating all this data, I focused my attention on the sell page andcomposed a list of improvements to make to the page. Some of the proposed changes included: adding customer reviews and social proof; shortening the overall length of the page; including language that explains how the product will solve customer’s problems above the fold; reducing the number of items in the main navigation; adding 2 CTA’s above the fold; using a persistent navigation that is always visible.
                    </p>
                    <h3>results</h3>
                    <p>The marketing materials and sales page were redesigned and launched. Marketing started November 2019 and will end the beginning of February 2020. There are several metrics that we are tracking to determine our success with the redesign. One metric we are tracking is total number of product sales. With only a third of the way into the marketing window, the redesign has an average of 8.9 sales per day, while the previous version had an average of 6 sales per day. This is a 67% improvement in product sales. For a $297 product this should result in an increase of $75,500 additional sales dollars for this one launch. We tend to market this product several times per year; 5 times in 2019. If we continue this marketing pattern for next year, the redesign should result in an increase of $377,500 for 2020.

            <div class="left"><h2>New Main Navigation on <span class="nowrap">E-commerce</span> Site</h2></div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3>summary</h3>
                <p>Analyze our customers use of our current navigation and design a more useful and easy to use replacement.
                </p>
                <h3>problem</h3>
                <img src="../img/st-homepage-navigation.png" alt="heatmap of the main navigation showing zero clicks">
                <p>None of our customers were using the main navigation on our website. A recent heatmaps showed that out of 10,000 users, not one click went to the navigation. As a result, our users were using search as their primary means of locating products and information.
                </p>
                <h3>hypothesis</h3>
                <p>Working with the design and product manager, I hypothesized there were several reasons why our users were not using the main navigation: the link text was too specific, confusing, and there were too many items (11 links). </p>
                <h3>data to the rescue</h3>
                <p>I analyzed the search term data from the website from Q1 2019. The results showed that the majority (44.8%)  of searches are for a specific author name. The next highest was topic (32.7%), followed by product title (13.1%).
                </p>
                <h3>proposed solution</h3>
                <p>Working with the design and product manager, we took all this data and created a new navigation that focused on the search terms our customers used. After two sets of in-person paper prototype tests, discussions with internal product teams, and several rounds of revisions, we finalized the wireframes for the new navigation.
                </p>
                <p>Here is the wireframe for the main navigation:</p>

                <h3>results</h3>
                <p>The designs are complete and we are currently in the process of implementing this new navigation. It is scheduled for launch early 2020. </p>

        <div class="project firstish" id="categories">
            <div class="left"><h2>Product Categories on <span class="nowrap">E-commerce</span> Site</h2></div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3>summary</h3>
                <p>Determine new categories for all 8.5k products on an e-commerce site.</p>
                <h3>problem</h3>
                <p>The current product categories on our site are oddly specific, confusing, and are not industry-standard for our niche.</p>
                <h3>data to the rescue</h3>
                <p>There were several sets of data that was used to compile our new categories. First, we used the search term data from the website. The second highest (32.7%) type of search term used by our customers (Q1 2019) was topic, such as: mindfulness, meditation, yoga, etc. We then ranked the topic search terms our customers were using.
                </p>
                <img src="../img/topics.png" alt="the most searched for toppics">
                <p>This clearly showed what topics our customers are most interested in. The second set of data we considered were the categories used by our direct competitors: Amazon, Hay House, Llewellyn, Inner Traditions, Shift Networks. The third set of data we considered were the number of products we have in the initial list of categories. There needed to be a sufficient amount of products in each category.
                </p>
                <h3>proposed solution</h3>
                <p>After considering these three sets of data, we agreed on a list of 14 parent categories and 20 child categories. Several different teams then went through our entire catalog of 8.5k products and recategorized them.
                </p>
                <h3>results</h3>
                <p>This newly recategorized product catalog has been uploaded to our under-construction site. The website is scheduled for launch early 2020.

            <div class="left"><h2>Digital Library PWA (Progressive Web Application)</h2></div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3>summary</h3>
                <p>Design the layout and user flows for our new PWA. This new PWA is replacing our native iOS and Android apps.
                </p>
                <h3>data to the rescue</h3>
                <p>Fortunately, we have several hundred app reviews for both our iOS and Android apps. In general our customers disappointed in the apps' lack of features that are commonly found in similar media applications, such as iTunes, Netflix, Amazon, Audible, etc.
                </p>
                <h3>proposed solution</h3>
                <p>The need to ship a MVP quickly has restricted the list of features that are initially being implemented. The MVP will be a parity of the current experience, with a few of the glaring issues resolved, for example: customers will now be able to read an ebook directly within the PWA.

                <h3>research</h3>
                <p>I designed and ran one round of in-person paper prototype user tests using my initial low-fidelity mock-ups. These tests resulted in several minor changes to the designs. I then ran a round of in-person interactive prototype tests. I built the prototype using high-fidelity Sketch designs imported into InVision. These user tests produced positive results: no major usability issues were found.
                </p>
                <h3>results</h3>
                <p>The PWA is currently in the process of being built. It is scheduled to launch early 2020.</p>
